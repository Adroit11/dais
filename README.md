### Resolved Decisions
- Framework: CodeIgniter with [Ion Auth](https://github.com/benedmunds/CodeIgniter-Ion-Auth)
- Languages: PHP, jQuery/JavaScript, Less
- Database: MySQL
- Design: Based mostly on [Twitter Bootstrap](github.com/twbs/bootstrap) with influences from [Bootswatch Flatly](http://bootswatch.com/flatly/)
- Environment: Shared Hosting (Linux/MySQL/PHP)

Alternatives
--------------
Other student developers have no doubt tried tackling some of these problems.
- [Huxley](github.com/bmun/huxley) by Berkeley Model United Nations, using Django and Facebook's React
  * We decided against using and expanding Huxley because of the constraints of our web host.

About NUMUN
-------------
NUMUN is Northwestern University's Model United Nations club and an annual conference in Evanston, IL for delegates at the high school level. We are Northwestern University students dedicated to crafting the best Model UN conference in the Midwest. This will be our 12th year, but we are still focused on a personal and meaningful experience for all delegates.

The Northwestern University Model United Nations conference originated in 2004 when a group of dedicated Northwestern undergrads sought to fill a void in the communityâ€™s extracurriculars. In the years since, the conference has almost doubled in size, but its dedication to delegate experience has never changed. NUMUN is typically hosted every year at the Norris University Center on campus, directly adjacent to Lake Michigan.
